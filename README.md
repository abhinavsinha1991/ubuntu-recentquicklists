# ubuntu-recentquicklists

Finally, there is a recent-files quicklist for ubuntu, as windows already has for quite some time.
This script adds recent files to the right-click on the unity-dash's launchers (program icons).

Required: python3

Usage: python3 "ubuntu-recentquicklists" &

Huge thanks to 
https://forum.ubuntuusers.de/topic/libreoffice-unity-dynamische-quicklist/
, which provided the framework to expand the functionality from being limited to libre-office to serve all applications.
